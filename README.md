I created TinDog, a simple web page for dog lovers and their furry friends during Angela Yu course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/.

TinDog is a startup landing page for a fictional application that helps users find other dogs and their owners nearby, using a swipe left/right feature similar to Tinder.

The result is a responsive design with a modern and clean look that is easy to navigate. I am proud of this project as it was a great opportunity for me to learn and practice my skills in web development.
